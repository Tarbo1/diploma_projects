    "Опис": "Filmtype: Black&White\nFilm Format: 35 mm\nSpeed: ISO 100/21°\nLength: 36 Exposures\nPDF-Datenblatt\nPDF-Datasheet\n\n\nADOX CHS 100 II produces delicate, soft, airy images with open shadows, creamy highlights and a smooth tonal transition.\nThe orthopanchromatic emulsion features a reduced red sensitivity and a curve gap between blue and green, producing deeper skies with standing-out clouds and a balanced tonal reproduction in portraiture. Along with classical grain, CHS 100 II is perfect for fine art photography, delivering a true 1960’s film look.\n\nThis film is made of two emulsions coated in a single layer on an archival clear PET 100 micron base, resulting in very large exposure latitude. CHS 100 II responds very well to pull- and push-processing.\n\nIn 35mm format ADOX CHS100 II has two anti-halation layers (between the emulsion and the base, and on the backside), making it very sharp. The backside AH layer also diminishes curling and reduces the light-piping effect. This effect of light penetrating through the base into the cartridge is immanent to all polyester-based films and cannot be fully prevented. CHS 100 II should be protected from bright light which can fog the first few frames. It is best to be loaded in the shadow or subdued light.\n\nCHS 100 II sharpness and contrast can be managed with various developers: velvety soft results in Atomal, balanced contrast and optimal sharpness in FX-39 and elevated contrast with extra high definition in Adonal/Rodinal. Tanning developers are not recommended.",

This is roughly equivalent to a 500 megapixel resolution.\nADOX CMS 20 II has cubic silver grains of even grain size, which are coated in a single, ultra finest-grain, ultra-thin layer. The AHU Anti-halation layer between the emulsion and film base guarantees the optimal film sharpness.\n\nADOX ADOTECH IV developer is the special developer for ADOX CMS 20 II for optimal results in classic pictorial half- tone photography. ADOTECH IV is designed to bring the perfect gray scales and tonality to this otherwise very hard-contrast film material and will give you images with such incredible detail that no one will believe that they were shot on 35mm film.\nWith ADOTECH IV this film can be used in a light sensitivity range of EI 3/6° up to 25/15°.\n\nIn a normal standard developer, the light sensitivity increases up to ISO 80/20° and the contrast becomes ultra-hard. When developed this way, the film can be used as a document film.",

We are preparing the next batch now. As soon as it is available, you can order here again.\n\nCOLOR MISSION\nA new ISO 200 color film from ADOX with a mission\n\nADOX is releasing Color Mission - a film with delicately vibrant minty greens, peachy reds, airy grain and a purpose at the core. The name is intentional: those small 35mm rolls are on a big mission to give the analog community a beautiful product while investing into the future of film research and production, which is one of the most sophisticated challenges in the analog industry.\n\nOne batch of color film has been co-researched with and coated for ADOX by a company, which went bankrupt shortly after the first run. Now, ADOX is starting a fully independent R&D for color film, which requires significant investments. The ADOX chemical production is financing the research of new photochemistry. The Polywarmtone emulsion is helping to advance the paper product development. Now, time has come to release Color Mission - those films coated a few years ago, kept in the cool house until this moment.\n\n\nAll the sales profits from this product will be going specifically to film research - not chemistry, not paper emulsion - film. Realistically, a new film is not coming next year - in four years, perhaps. The supply of Color Mission will be enough for this time, and possibly a bit longer.\n\nThe ADOX team is excited to be starting a journey to a completely new product for the analog community, while already making a unique color film available for their amazing supporters.\n\nThis product is exclusively available direct from Fotoimpex.\n\nLearn more about the color mission story",

However when we sell a kit we cannot reduce the stock of the individual items and double sales are possible. In this case we might not be able to ship same day even when showing stock. But because we have a very large stock this hardly ever happens.\n\nThe individual product descriptions follow.\n\nILFORD Delta 100 135/36 Kleinbildfilm\nILFORD DELTA 100: Light Sensitivity ISO 100/21°.\n\nThe Delta line is Ilford's flagship film line. Core-Shell™ crystal technology results in excellent sharpness, very high resolution and very fine grain at higher sensitivities. Good negative characteristics. Delta 100 has a bit better sharpness and higher resolution than PanF+. But PanF+ has a bit finer grain.\nDelta 100 surpasses in many developers T-Max 100 and Acros II 100 in contour/edge sharpness. It is also significantly sharper, higher resolving and finer grained than all ISO 100/21° films with conventional grain technology like e.g. FP4+, Kentmere 100, Fomapan 100 etc..\nThe characteristic curve of Delta 100 can be well controlled by the choice of developer. E.g. with Ilford DD-X, XTOL or Tetenal Ultrafin T-Plus you get a very linear characteristic curve. And with a compensating developer like ADOX ATOMAL and ADOX FX-39 II you get a characteristic curve with the compensating effect resulting in lower densities in the highlights. From a technological point of view Delta 100 is one of the best films in Ilford's film portfolio.\n\n\n\n\nADOX FX-39 TYPE II 100 ml conc.\nFX-39 is a perfect substitute for Rodinal in case you can´t order Rodinal due to hazmat shipping restrictions.\n\nFX-39 is a legend.\nFor more than 40 years Geoffrey Crawley has readjusted and optimized different developer recipes. And created this masterpiece in the heydays of film. FX-39 is based on Willi Beutler’s Neofin Rot formula, but was improved in all parameters. Since about 10 years ADOX is improving this formulary.\nFX-39 is a compensating developer, providing excellent detail rendition, sharpness and resolution. The effective film speed is high. The compensating effect can be well controlled in a very wide range by variations in dilution. The compensating effect can be precisely adjusted to the subject contrast and film type. There remains only one reason for not using FX-39 exclusively and that is absolutely finest grain. If you want the finest grain possible than finest grain developers like Adox Atomal are the optimal solution. FX-39 harmonizes excellently especially with all low- and medium-speed films. In the ISO 400/27° class the best results are obtained with Kodak Tri-X, Kodak T-Max 400, Ilford Delta 400 and Fuji Neopan 400. If needed FX-39 can also be used for increasing film speed by 1 stop (push processing).\nAdox has produced FX-39 for Paterson since 2004. Geoffrey Crawley was here to transfer the formula and to support the implemention of the production. We promised him to keep his „baby“ alive and kicking, even when Paterson may decide to stop the distribution. As Paterson made this decision later on, FX-39 is now not only produced, but also branded and distributed by Adox.\nTechnical data:\n500ml developer concentrate.\nStandard dilution: 1+9 “one-shot” application.\nHigh dilution: 1+19 ”one-shot” application for increase of the compensating effect (by 75% extended developing time). By doing this film speed is a bit lower. So it is possible to trade compensating effect for film speed in a certain range.\nDeveloping times are listed on Digitaltruth.\n\nADOX BABY ADOFIX Plus 100 ml conc.\nFix intended for all black and white photo materials.\nHigh-capacity express fixer for black and white photo paper (RC or Fiber-based), film, and sheetfilm.\n\nIntended for use in trays, tanks, and maschines.\n\nWith one liter of concentrate, you can make up to 10 liters of working solution. Dilution is either 1+4 or 1+9.\n\nCapacity: 1.4 - 2 sq. meters of photo paper or 6-10 films per liter of working solution at 1+9 dilution.\nTotal capacity: 10 films or 45 sheets of 18x24cm photo paper.\n\n\nExcellent price value.\n\nGeneral recomendations for liquid fixers: Liquid fixers stay fresh if kept unopened for about 2 years.\nAfter opening the concentrate shall be used up within about 3 months.\nI case of flockulation or sulfuric fumes the fixer cannot be used anymore.",

If you want the finest grain possible than finest grain developers like Adox Atomal are the optimal solution. FX-39 harmonizes excellently especially with all low- and medium-speed films. In the ISO 400/27° class the best results are obtained with Kodak Tri-X, Kodak T-Max 400, Ilford Delta 400 and Fuji Neopan 400.

This is roughly equivalent to a 500 megapixel resolution.\nADOX CMS 20 II has cubic silver grains of even grain size, which are coated in a single, ultra finest-grain, ultra-thin layer.

ADOTECH IV is designed to bring the perfect gray scales and tonality to this otherwise very hard-contrast film material and will give you images with such incredible detail that no one will believe that they were shot on 35mm film.\nWith ADOTECH IV this film can be used in a light sensitivity range of EI 3/6° up to 25/15°.\n\nIn a normal standard developer, the light sensitivity increases up to ISO 80/20° and the contrast becomes ultra-hard.

This, in the past, immanent challenge in high resolution procedures has been eliminated to a great extend.\n\nADOTECH IV yields a yet improved tonal separation as well as significantly improved shadow details. The usable ISO of 20/14° to 25/15° are now even closer to a \"true speed\" of 20.\n\nAll CMS 20 II films , that have been delivered to our customers since 2011, can be processed with both, the ADOTECH III and ADOTECH IV developer.\n\nPlease be aware of times and diluting properties on each bottle.\n\nWith a recommended dilution of 1+14 you will get 1500 ml of working solution.

    "Опис": "Filmtype: Colour Print Film\nFilm Format: 35 mm\nThe world’s sharpest and finest grain color negative film!\n\nCINESTILL 50Daylight is an ISO 50/18° speed daylight balanced (5500K) color negative motion picture film stock for still photography. Based on the original Vision3 50D emulsion, this film is prepped and rolled for clean and safe standard photo lab processing or Cs41 development at home, but it may also be processed in Cs2 chemistry for low-contrast motion picture negatives. Ideal for shooting in bright light at wide apertures and for producing high resolution, low grain images.\n\nThe exposure latitude of this film is beyond anything digital and even most other films can hope to achieve. With 50D you can achieve beautiful results by rating it anywhere between ISO 12-100 without the need for push processing. No matter how you meter, you will see almost no grain, but color, contrast, shadow detail and highlight rendering will be affected by the chosen ISO you meter at. If you expose at a lower ISO you will get warmer images with greater halation in the highlights.\n\nCineStill's new and improved manufacturing process now extends the shelf life of 50D, with less noticeable artifacts after expiration. This emulsion is optimized for a hybrid workflow, ideal for scanning, and produces a complimentary contrast curve for optical printing on RA-4 paper when processed in C-41 chemistry.\n\nFEATURES\n• Color negative motion picture emulsion\n• 35mm / 36exp.\n• Safe for C-41 photo lab processing (Remjet backing free)\n• Resulting in a slight halation effect\n• Daylight balanced (5500K)\n• Unrivaled highlight and shadow latitude\n• High resolution and fine grain for maximum sharpness\n• Factory spooled, DX-coded cassettes\n\n\nExpiration: The new boxed CineStill film has an extended shelf life with less noticeable artifacts after expiration, but should be stored in the fridge and shot within 6 months of purchase to achieve optimal results. Exposed film should be processed promptly in C-41 chemistry to preserve latent image latitude and color fidelity. All current productions of CineStill have expiration dates for two years from manufacture date on the box. If you have earlier productions of 800T (no retail box) or your film does not have an expiration date, it is likely age fogged.\n\nNote: This emulsion was designed originally requiring ECN-2 motion picture processing and may still be processed using ALL of those steps or with the CineStill Cs2 \"Cine Simplified\" kit, resulting in a pulled contrast negative with lower gamma not suitable for darkroom printing. Although there is no remjet adhesive layer to contaminate and exhaust the chemicals, C-41 processing produces greater density and gamma which is more favorable for still photography workflows. Tests show favorable results in standard C-41 processing compared to ECN-2 motion picture lab processing performed by professional labs. Long term archival stability has not been tested past 9 years. Expectations for archival longevity should be somewhere between Kodachrome and most C-41 films. We will replace any roll that shows defect. We do not accept any liability beyond replacement of original film purchased.\n\nStorage and handling: Load and unload film in subdued light. Store unexposed film in a refrigerator at 13°C (55°F) or lower in the original sealed package. To avoid moisture condensation on film that has been refrigerated, allow the film to warm up to room temperature before opening the package. Process film as soon as possible after exposure.

This advanced motion picture emulsion is optimized for a hybrid workflow, ideal for scanning, and safe to process in standard C-41 photo lab machines or Cs41 processing at home, but it may also be processed in Cs2 chemistry for low-contrast motion picture negatives. It also produces a complimentary contrast curve for optical printing on RA-4 paper when processed in C-41 chemistry. Treat this film as a high speed 800 ISO film for C-41 processing and push process whenever needed up to 3200 ISO!\n\nFEATURES\n• Color negative motion picture emulsion\n• Safe for C-41 photo lab processing (remjet backing free)\n• Resulting in a slight halation effect\n• 35mm / 36exp.\n• Tungsten balanced\n• Designed for difficult low light tungsten situations\n• Can be push-processed up to 3200 ISO\n• Factory spooled, DX-Coded cassetes\n\nRecommended acceptable exposure for push processing:\nNo push - EI 200-1000\n1 stop push - EI 800-2000\n2 stop push - EI 1250-3200\n3 stop push - EI 1600-3200 (added contrast)\nWhen shot in daylight, an 85B filter is recommended and/or shooting the film at 400-500 ISO.\n\nExpiration: The new boxed CineStill film has an extended shelf life with less noticeable artifacts after expiration, but should be stored in the fridge and shot within 6 months of purchase to achieve optimal results. Exposed film should be processed promptly in C-41 chemistry to preserve latent image latitude and color fidelity. All current productions of CineStill have expiration dates for two years from manufacture date on the box. If you have earlier productions of 800T (no retail box) or your film does not have an expiration date, it is likely age fogged.\n\nNote: This emulsion was designed originally requiring ECN-2 motion picture processing and may still be processed using ALL of those steps or with the CineStill Cs2 \"Cine Simplified\" kit, resulting in a pulled contrast negative with lower gamma not suitable for darkroom printing. Although there is no remjet adhesive layer to contaminate and exhaust the chemicals, C-41 processing produces greater density and gamma which is more favorable for still photography workflows. Tests show favorable results in standard C-41 processing compared to ECN-2 motion picture lab processing performed by professional labs. Long term archival stability has not been tested past 9 years. Expectations for archival longevity should be somewhere between Kodachrome and most C-41 films. We will replace any roll that shows defect. We do not accept any liability beyond replacement of original film purchased.\n\nStorage and handling: Load and unload film in subdued light. Store unexposed film in a refrigerator at 13°C (55°F) or lower in the original sealed package. To avoid moisture condensation on film that has been refrigerated, allow the film to warm up to room temperature before opening the package. Process film as soon as possible after exposure. Protect processed film from strong light, and store it in a cool, dry place.",

And they have continuously supplied the market with their colour reversal / transparency film types even in the most difficult and problematic times of the market - as the only manufacturer.\n\nWith Provia 100F Fujifilm has established the benchmark for colour reversal films with neutral-natural colour rendition:\nProvia 100F Professional (RDP III) is a medium-sensitive daylight-balanced transparency film with ISO 100/21° with exceptionally fine grain, excellent sharpness and resolution, natural-vivid color reproduction, very wide scale of tone reproduction and extremely neutral gray color balance.\nTypical for all Fujifilm films the differentiation of green tones is very good and the rendition of sky blue is excellent (perfect for landscape photography).\nWhether portrait, fashion, landscape, architecture, product and advertising photography, travel, still-life or night photography, Provia 100F always provides excellent results because of its very well balanced neutral and natural colour rendition and its perfect reproduction of fine details. A real all-round film.\n\nAnother significant advantage of Provia 100F is its excellent flexibility concerning the usable light sensitivity range from Exposure Index (EI) 50/18° to 400/27°:\nExposed at EI 50/18° or 64/19° and with accordingly adjusted pull processing Provia provides really excellent results. Optimal for example for reducing contrast in situations with very high object contrast.\nIf a higher sensitivity is needed, Provia can also be exposed at EI 200/24° without any problems: At that film speed and with accordingly adjusted push-1 processing you will also get really excellent results.\nAnd even an exposure at EI 400/27° in combination with a push-2 processing is possible with still good results.\n\nFujichrome Provia 100F has the widest exposure latitude (and dynamic range) of all current colour reversal films.\nAnd it is cheaper than the other transparency films and offers excellent value for money / excellent price-performance ratio.\n\nAn absolute unique characteristic of Provia 100F is its outstanding performance concerning the reciprocity failure:\nUp to 128 seconds (> 2 minutes) exposure time no exposure compensation is needed! This makes Provia the perfect film for long exposure and night photography. No other colour film can offer that outstanding feature. Provia is a league of its own in this regard.\n\nFujichrome Provia 100F has significant better sharpness, higher resolution and a bit wider exposure latitude compared to Kodak Ektachrome E100. Concerning fineness of grain both films are on the same level. In direct comparison Ektachrome E100 has a bit cooler (more blue) colour rendition.\nTypical for colour reversal film Provia 100F surpasses all colour negative films of the market in the parameters sharpness, resolution, fineness of grain and colour brillance.\n\nGeneral colour reversal film tip:\nWith colour reversal / transparency film you have a perfect, finished positive photo already after film processing. You can enjoy the perfect quality without the need of further costly steps: No need for scans or prints (as with colour negative film). Therefore the overall costs per finished final positive picture are often lower with colour reversal film compared to colour negative film.",

The official ISO-sensitivity of Delta 3200 is 1000/31° due to the datasheet. But the film is so designed, that you also get very good results at the push-sensitivities EI 1600/33° and EI 3200/36°. Especially in high-speed developers like ADOX ATOMAL and Ilford DD-X. The Delta line is Ilford's flagship film line. Core-Shell™ crystal technology gives - relatively speaking - a fine grain with maximum sensitivity. Of course at this film speed it is more grainy than lower speed films. But you can still get a clean 18x24cm print out of the film. Unlike the TMAX 3200, this film is also available in 120 Rollfilm, which makes this film especially interesting. The 4-layer coating technology makes the Ilford 3200 very flexible concerning the usable exposure index range: from EI 400/27° to 6400/39°.",

Ilford's SFX is not a \"real\" infrared film like the former Efke IR820 or the Kodak HIE, but it is a film with an extended red sensitivity. The benefit to the user is the better usability and easier processing. The downside is that the photos are not \"true\" infrared images, but photos with an infrared-like effect. However, the film can be given to almost any photo lab for developing and the exposures can be made using just a dark red filter. But the strongest and most visible \"Wood-effect\" is achieved by using an infrared filter which blocks the light below 715nm (e.g. Heliopan RG 715, available here in the shop). Ilford SFX 200 is ideal for infrared-beginners or to try out IR film in a Holga camera.",

    "Опис": "Filmtype: Colour Slide\nFilm Format: 35 mm\nSpeed: ISO 100/21°\nLength: 36 Exposures\nA Classic is back!\n\nIn 2012 Kodak had unfortunately stopped their color reversal film production completely. All films were discontinued. Now with the Ektachrome E100 at least one Kodak color reversal / transparency film type is back.\n\nEktachrome E100 offers extremely fine grain, a vivid, brillant color rendition and very good tonality.\nKodak has chosen the former Ektachrome E100 G as basis for the new E100. But because certain raw materials, which were used in former E100 G, are meanwhile not available anymore, the new E100 is different in certain parameters compared to its forerunner E100 G.\n\nThe rendition of blue, especially blue of the sky, is visibly improved (no cyan color cast anymore like with its forerunner and like all current Kodak color negative films).\nThe new E100 has neutral to slightly cool (emphasis of blue) color rendition. Therefore it is visibly different to its forerunner E100 G, which was neutral to slightly warm. The color rendition of E100 is also a bit cooler than the very neutral-natural Fujichrome Provia 100F with its very precise and very well balanced color rendition.\nTherefore Ektachrome E100 with its slightly cooler color rendition takes a unique position in the current Kodak film portfolio: It is the only Kodak film with a tendency towards cooler tones, as all Kodak color negative films have an either slightly warm (Portra 160) or significantly warm (Portra 400 / 800, Ektar, all amateur color negative films) color rendition.\n\nThe extreme fineness of grain of former E100 G could be maintained with new E100 (RMS value of 8).\nBut the resolution of new E100 is unfortunately a little bit lower.\nThe new E100 has a bit steeper gradation (works a bit more contrasty) than its forerunner, and the exposure latitude is a bit lower, too.\n\nIn direct comparison to Fujichrome Provia 100F new Ektachrome E100 has a slightly cooler color rendition.\nFujichrome Provia 100F has a significantly better sharpness, better resolution (higher MTF) and a bit better exposure latitude in comparison to E100.\nConcerning fineness of grain both films are on the same extremely high level.\n\nGeneral colour reversal film tip:\nWith colour reversal / transparency film you have a perfect, finished positive photo already after film processing. You can enjoy the perfect quality without the need of further costly steps: No need for scans or prints (as with colour negative film). Therefore the overall costs per finished final positive picture are often lower with colour reversal film compared to colour negative film.",

    "Опис": "Filmtype: Black&White\nFilm Format: 35 mm\nSpeed: ISO 3200/36°\nLength: 36 Exposures\nExpiry date 02/23\n\nKodak T-Max 3200 Professional is Kodak's most light-sensitive film. The specialist for available-light photography.\nThe nominal sensivity is ISO 800/30°, but a one-stop push to ISO 1600/33° or a two-stop push to ISO 3200/36° are also possible. This film is specifically designed for that: Despite the push process the contrast remains moderate, and the lights keep sufficient detail.\nBecause with exposure and development at ISO 800/30° the characteristic curve of this film is flattening out in the light zones. With exposure and development at ISO 1600/33° and ISO 3200/36° the characteristic curve gets a more linear shape. With conventional films you often get a too steep characteristic curve with too high contrast by pushing. But the design of T-Max 3200 reduces this problem significantly.\nIf required by the shooting situation, even an exposure and development of ISO 6400/39° is possible. The loss of shadow and highlight detail is relatively acceptable regarding the very high sensivity.\n\nBesides its excellent flexibility in push processing T-Max 3200 also has comparatively fine grain, high resolution and very good sharpness.\n\"This film excels when shooting in low light or when capturing fast action,” Kodak Alaris says. “It is ideally suited for handheld street scene photography, night work, and in dimly lit venues where you can’t use flash.”\nIt is also very good in situations when neither high-speed lenses nor lenses with image stabilisation technology are available.",

With low ISO and a small exposure latitude, this impactful black and white film navigates inter-tonal shifts with ease resulting in rich, low grain depictions with vibrant microcontrast. The Fantôme Kino B&W Film brings scenes to life, capturing life’s most evocative moments in show stopping black and white splendor.\n\nA Director's Dream\nThis panchromatic is perfect for seasoned professionals and creative first time photographers alike. Particularly appropriate for those who like to take full manual control and experiment with flash photography, the Fantôme Kino B&W Film packs drama into the frame with crushed shadows and super high contrast renderings, reminiscent of our favourite Film Noir classics.\n\nMaster your Low ISO Monochromes\nThis film has a slow speed of ISO 8, so we recommend using a camera and lens with manual controls for better control over your exposures. You should be able to manually adjust the shutter speed of your camera and aperture of your lens. Using a fast lens (maximum aperture of at least f/1.4 - f/2.8), is also recommended.\nThis evocative emulsion can be developed both in the lab or at home with the standard black and white process. Whether you are a dab hand in the darkroom or looking to boost your development skills, we are here to help and have created a bespoke Fantôme Kino B&W Film Guide with everything you need to know including tips, tricks, filters and a development chart.",

More control over your results and many creative possibilities, because this film allows you to achieve different effects by changing the ISO settings. The palette ranges from glowing red tones to red and blue understatement. The best thing about it: All of this is possible with just a single roll of film.\n\nDecide on your desired effect and set the appropriate ISO default. If you are looking for intense red tones and an atmospheric orange, choose ISO 200/24°. If you want it to be less hot in terms of color, set your camera to ISO 50/18° and you will get a cool blue-green image-look.\n\nProcess C-41.",

    "Опис": "Expiry Date 02/2021\n\n\nSilberra PAN100 is panchromatic negative black and white photo film with ISO value of 100. Extrafine grain, wide tonal range, perfect sharpness and moderate contrast are typical for Silberra PAN100 film. There's also Silberra ULTIMA100 b&w film which is identical to Silberra PAN100, except the thickness of the substrate (the substrate at ULTIMA100 film is thinner, which makes it a bit easier media to scan and print).\n\nHere are the main features of Silberra PAN series:\n1) Low noise, low fog level and extremely fine grain are the special features of emulsion used for Silberra PAN films;\n2) Silberra PAN films were derived from Agfa films for surveillance, by widening the dynamic range, lowering contrast and saving several specials, which include:\n\nextremely high resolution and ideal sharpness of the image;\nability to provide superior detail level through the whole tonal range;\nhigher sensitivity for near-IR spectrum of light, which not only provides you near IR-effects when shooting landscapes, but offers you higher detalization in twilights or while shooting the scenes with insufficient light level;\n3) The emulsion is coated upon clear polyester base which offers ultimate stability of the material and perfect optical properties; thickness of the substrate is 0.1 mm and it has excellent antihalo layer on the outer side to grant you an excellent sharpness of the image;\n4) Silberra PAN films have special anti-curling layer, which makes drying much easier (there is no need in additional weights or clips on the bottom of the stripe when drying: the film won't curl);\n5) Special formulae of the polyester base and protective layers provide scratch resistance, prevent water traces and offer in-built anti-static properties, which makes any Silberra PAN film very convenient for hybrid and classic processing;\nSilberra PAN films are perfect for use in street photography, portrait photography, landscape and architectural photography. Special features of 2-layer emulsion make this film ideal to use at dusk/dawn, in winter and at complicated lighting ambience.\n\nDeveloping process (depending on the specific developer) can infuse into final image such features as adamant gloss within bright areas accompanied by highly detailed shadows, or make the final image reasonably even along the whole light spectrum.\n\nSilberra PAN films are optimal for use in natural light. Using the film in artificial light is subject to preliminary tests due to high sensitivity in red and near-IR light spectrum. We recommend shooting several frames and processing those prior to any professional photo sessions in studios. Choosing the color temperature of artificial light sources and their power is vital to obtain predictably perfect results.\n\nSilberra PAN100 is able to provide excellent image at cloudy weather, in fog and at dusk; the final image will have perfect shadow details preserving the overall high resolution (240 lines/mm at 1000:1 TOC contrast).\n\nOfficially the exposure range for Silberra PAN100 – 80, 100 and 160ISO. Lowering the sensitivity below 80 may cause loss of reasonable contrast, while increasing the sensitivity over 160 could increase the graininess and noise level.\n\nUsing yellow filters provide increased contrast and lowers the overall sensitivity of emulsion. Using the filters you shall bear in mind the next exposition multipliers (besides the coefficient of the filter itself):\nYellow filter - 1.5;\nDark yellow/ orange filter – 1.8;\nRed filter – 3 or 4 depending on the wave length of the filter;\n\nArchival capacity of Silberra PAN100 is not confirmed practically; the guaranteed archival storage period thus is stated as over 10 years without image quality loss. Silberra recomends archival storage using special archival file sleevers (triacetate, paper of pergament) in cold (below 20 degrees of Celcium), dry and cool place.",

Made for centuries in Japan, this paper combines just the right physical properties with a unique aesthetic: strong, flexible and transparent, Washi is the ideal medium for creating a hand-crafted photographic film.\n\nWashi film has a basic sensitivity of 25 iso when process in Tetenal Eukobrom at 1+1 dilution (you can reuse the solution for several rolls or sheet-film).\n\nThis Film is orthochromatic: sensitive to the blue end of the spectrum while being relatively insensitive to the red. This means that Washi Film can be handled under a red safelight (> 545nm).\n\nEasy to handle and develop, Washi Film is available in conventional photographic formats: 120, 620 and 4x5. It is processed in normal black and white paper developer. As an handmade product, Washi Film must be carrefully clean with cold clean water to ensure optimal conservation of the negative. Each film is sold with a technical data sheet detailing how to expose and process it. The negative can then either be scanned or printed by contact or with an enlarger. Only traditionnal prints or transparency scan can reveal the full potential of Washi negative. Simple scan would give an overexposed veil over the picture.\nAs Washi large format films are much thinner and flexible than regular sheet-films, it could be sometimes harder to load in film-holders. To make this operation easier, you can place a piece of photo paper of the same size above the Washi Film and load it together. Then you can take away the photo paper and leave the sheet-film in position.",

Full mixing and usage instructions are included, along with a developing time table for Fomapan R. Other films can be developed by slightly varying the first developing time (5 - 11 min).\n\n\n\nAttention: the reversal developing process is complicated! There are a few things that you need to watch out for. Since potassium bichromat can no longer be used, the bleach bath is a little touchy. The bleach bath used in this kit goes bad quickly. Therefore you need to mix the bleach just before you use it - preferably you should mix it during the developing process, run it through a coffee filter, and then use it. Be sure to bleach for a sufficient length of time! It is also very important that the film gets sufficient light during the second exposure.\n\ncapacity:\n\n8 films 135/36\n\nor\n\n2 Super8/DS8/N8 Filme 15 Meter\n\nor\n\n1 film 16mm 30,5m/100ft\n\n\n*Some chemicals must not be transported in a world airfreight parcel.

Made for centuries in Japan, this paper combines just the right physical properties with a unique aesthetic: strong, flexible and transparent, Washi is the ideal medium for creating a hand-crafted photographic film.\n\nWashi film has a basic sensitivity of 25 iso when process in Tetenal Eukobrom at 1+1 dilution (you can reuse the solution for several rolls or sheet-film).\n\nThis Film is orthochromatic: sensitive to the blue end of the spectrum while being relatively insensitive to the red. This means that Washi Film can be handled under a red safelight (> 545nm).\n\nEasy to handle and develop, Washi Film is available in conventional photographic formats: 120, 620 and 4x5. It is processed in normal black and white paper developer. As an handmade product, Washi Film must be carrefully clean with cold clean water to ensure optimal conservation of the negative. Each film is sold with a technical data sheet detailing how to expose and process it. The negative can then either be scanned or printed by contact or with an enlarger. Only traditionnal prints or transparency scan can reveal the full potential of Washi negative. Simple scan would give an overexposed veil over the picture.\nAs Washi large format films are much thinner and flexible than regular sheet-films, it could be sometimes harder to load in film-holders. To make this operation easier, you can place a piece of photo paper of the same size above the Washi Film and load it together. Then you can take away the photo paper and leave the sheet-film in position.",

They all need to made sure not to be in the same room with you. In addition make sure that you are not full of charge yourself. For this ground yourself and touch something iron ore. Sometimes the body expels little flashes of light which will indeed ruin your film for good.\n\nLoading your own film saves time and money. You can also load a cartridge with a couple of feet of material and have less exposures so you don't have to wait until the full fledged 36 pictures are exposed.\n\nThere is no “counter\" on this machine but if you twist the wheel for abut 12 times than you have just about 36 exposures on the role.\n\nAlso it doesn't tell you how much film is left in the loader. HOWEVER, use a kitchen scale from the beginning: you do the math. (Don't forget there ought to be know light)",

Among all current B/W negative films on the market only ADOX CMS 20 II has an even significantly finer grain than HR-50.\n\nIn portrait photography we recommend our dedicated ADOX HR-DEV developer or ADOX FX-39 II.\n\nADOX HR-50 can be used as an infrared film and responds extremely well to any sort of filtration (yellow, orange, red, blue, green).\nThe new ADOX *SNAP-ON*- Gelatin Filters are a perfect match.\nTo make the start in infrared photography easier, ADOX has designed a slight infrared filter for the ADOX SNAP-ON filter system. With this IR filter only one stop more light is needed. So handheld shots with EI 25/15° are possible.\nThe ADOX SNAP-ON Filters are available from 7.99 EUR on.\n\nFor infrared shots with maximum \"Wood effect\" (green leaves become white) we recommend a strong IR filter which blocks the visible light below 715 nanometer. The pictures get a dramatic and unique look.\n\nEmulsion: Superpanchromatic\nResolution: Up to 280 lp/mm at an image contrast of 1000:1\nISO: 50/18°\nBase: 0,1mm PET\nAnti Halation: Combined AHU/NC",

Spectral sensitisation up to 795 nm for infrared similar effects like Illford SFX 200 film. Easy handling. Infrared effect only with filters which block visible light up to 715 nm (like Heliopan RG 715). Ideal for beginners in IR photography. Try with a Holga too.\n\nExposed at EI 400/27° this film has a very strong S-shaped characteristic curve. This results in a very contrasty look with very low levels of shadow detail and very clearly separated mid-tones. If such contrasty look is not wanted it is recommended to expose with 2-3 stops more light and adjust development time accordingly (shorter development time).\nPhotographers who prefer optimal shadow detail, highest light sensitivity and evenly graded grey tones in their infrared photography will find their optimal film in ILFORD SFX 200.",

The effect was reduced to a large extend but cannot be fully prevented. Thus CHS 100 II, like any other film on PET base, has to be protected from bright light whilst the film-tongue is sticking out of the cartridge.\nOr else light will penetrate through the base into the cartridge and haze the beginning of the film.",

But because we have a very large stock this hardly ever happens.\n\nThe individual product descriptions follow.\n\nCINESTILL 800Tungsten Farbnegativfilm 120\nCINESTILL 800Tungsten is a unique color film for still photographers. This ISO 800 speed tungsten balanced color negative film is based on the same gold standard motion picture technology used by top cinematographers around the world. Designed for difficult low light tungsten situations, this flexible film is suitable for use in different lighting situations to achieve a variety of looks. Our new and improved manufacturing process now extends the shelf life of 800T, with less noticeable artifacts after expiration. This advanced motion picture emulsion is optimized for a hybrid workflow, ideal for scanning, and safe to process in standard C-41 photo lab machines or Cs41 processing at home, but it may also be processed in Cs2 chemistry for low-contrast motion picture negatives. It also produces a complimentary contrast curve for optical printing on RA-4 paper when processed in C-41 chemistry. Treat this film as a high speed 800 ISO film for C-41 processing and push process whenever needed up to 3200 ISO!\n\nFEATURES\n• Color negative motion picture emulsion\n• 120 medium format\n• Safe for C-41 photo lab processing (remjet backing free)\n• Resulting in a slight halation effect\n• Tungsten balanced\n• Designed for difficult low light tungsten situations\n• Can be push-processed up to 3200 ISO\n• Factory spooled\n\nRecommended acceptable exposure for push processing:\nNo push - EI 200-1000\n1 stop push - EI 800-2000\n2 stop push - EI 1250-3200\n3 stop push - EI 1600-3200 (added contrast)\nWhen shot in daylight, an 85B filter is recommended and/or shooting the film at 400-500 ISO.\n\nExpiration: The new boxed CineStill film has an extended shelf life with less noticeable artifacts after expiration, but should be stored in the fridge and shot within 6 months of purchase to achieve optimal results. Exposed film should be processed promptly in C-41 chemistry to preserve latent image latitude and color fidelity. All current productions of CineStill have expiration dates for two years from manufacture date on the box. If you have earlier productions of 800T (no retail box) or your film does not have an expiration date, it is likely age fogged.\n\nNote: This emulsion was designed originally requiring ECN-2 motion picture processing and may still be processed using ALL of those steps or with the CineStill Cs2 \"Cine Simplified\" kit, resulting in a pulled contrast negative with lower gamma not suitable for darkroom printing. Although there is no remjet adhesive layer to contaminate and exhaust the chemicals, C-41 processing produces greater density and gamma which is more favorable for still photography workflows. Tests show favorable results in standard C-41 processing compared to ECN-2 motion picture lab processing performed by professional labs. Long term archival stability has not been tested past 9 years. Expectations for archival longevity should be somewhere between Kodachrome and most C-41 films. We will replace any roll that shows defect. We do not accept any liability beyond replacement of original film purchased.\n\nStorage and handling: Load and unload film in subdued light. Store unexposed film in a refrigerator at 13°C (55°F) or lower in the original sealed package. To avoid moisture condensation on film that has been refrigerated, allow the film to warm up to room temperature before opening the package. Process film as soon as possible after exposure. Protect processed film from strong light, and store it in a cool, dry place.\n\nADOX M49 *SNAP-ON* 85B gelatine filter\nThe new ADOX \"SNAP-ON\" gelatine filters are budget color filters to increase your creativity. A tungsten conversion 85B filter converts the light in a way that tungsten film can be used outdoors. 85B being \"Full Tungsten Conversion (FTC)\" is perfect for this time of the year where the sun is barely seen outside.

But because we have a very large stock this hardly ever happens.\n\nThe individual product descriptions follow.\n\nCINESTILL 800Tungsten Farbnegativfilm 120\nCINESTILL 800Tungsten is a unique color film for still photographers. This ISO 800 speed tungsten balanced color negative film is based on the same gold standard motion picture technology used by top cinematographers around the world. Designed for difficult low light tungsten situations, this flexible film is suitable for use in different lighting situations to achieve a variety of looks. Our new and improved manufacturing process now extends the shelf life of 800T, with less noticeable artifacts after expiration. This advanced motion picture emulsion is optimized for a hybrid workflow, ideal for scanning, and safe to process in standard C-41 photo lab machines or Cs41 processing at home, but it may also be processed in Cs2 chemistry for low-contrast motion picture negatives. It also produces a complimentary contrast curve for optical printing on RA-4 paper when processed in C-41 chemistry. Treat this film as a high speed 800 ISO film for C-41 processing and push process whenever needed up to 3200 ISO!\n\nFEATURES\n• Color negative motion picture emulsion\n• 120 medium format\n• Safe for C-41 photo lab processing (remjet backing free)\n• Resulting in a slight halation effect\n• Tungsten balanced\n• Designed for difficult low light tungsten situations\n• Can be push-processed up to 3200 ISO\n• Factory spooled\n\nRecommended acceptable exposure for push processing:\nNo push - EI 200-1000\n1 stop push - EI 800-2000\n2 stop push - EI 1250-3200\n3 stop push - EI 1600-3200 (added contrast)\nWhen shot in daylight, an 85B filter is recommended and/or shooting the film at 400-500 ISO.\n\nExpiration: The new boxed CineStill film has an extended shelf life with less noticeable artifacts after expiration, but should be stored in the fridge and shot within 6 months of purchase to achieve optimal results. Exposed film should be processed promptly in C-41 chemistry to preserve latent image latitude and color fidelity. All current productions of CineStill have expiration dates for two years from manufacture date on the box. If you have earlier productions of 800T (no retail box) or your film does not have an expiration date, it is likely age fogged.\n\nNote: This emulsion was designed originally requiring ECN-2 motion picture processing and may still be processed using ALL of those steps or with the CineStill Cs2 \"Cine Simplified\" kit, resulting in a pulled contrast negative with lower gamma not suitable for darkroom printing. Although there is no remjet adhesive layer to contaminate and exhaust the chemicals, C-41 processing produces greater density and gamma which is more favorable for still photography workflows. Tests show favorable results in standard C-41 processing compared to ECN-2 motion picture lab processing performed by professional labs. Long term archival stability has not been tested past 9 years. Expectations for archival longevity should be somewhere between Kodachrome and most C-41 films. We will replace any roll that shows defect. We do not accept any liability beyond replacement of original film purchased.\n\nStorage and handling: Load and unload film in subdued light. Store unexposed film in a refrigerator at 13°C (55°F) or lower in the original sealed package. To avoid moisture condensation on film that has been refrigerated, allow the film to warm up to room temperature before opening the package. Process film as soon as possible after exposure. Protect processed film from strong light, and store it in a cool, dry place.\n\nADOX M62 *SNAP-ON* 85B gelatine filter\nThe new ADOX \"SNAP-ON\" gelatine filters are budget color filters to increase your creativity. A tungsten conversion 85B filter converts the light in a way that tungsten film can be used outdoors. 85B being \"Full Tungsten Conversion (FTC)\" is perfect for this time of the year where the sun is barely seen outside.

Relatively fine grained and with good sharpness. Flexible film with wide exposure latitude good push capabalities with 1-2 stop pushs.\nIn ADOX Rodinal / ADONAL developed Tri-X renders very sharp and brillant, with visible beautifully-accentuated grain. For photographers who prefer finer grain ADOX ATOMAL is recommended.\n\n\n\n\nADOX FX-39 TYPE II 100 ml conc.\nFX-39 is a perfect substitute for Rodinal in case you can´t order Rodinal due to hazmat shipping restrictions.\n\nFX-39 is a legend.\nFor more than 40 years Geoffrey Crawley has readjusted and optimized different developer recipes. And created this masterpiece in the heydays of film. FX-39 is based on Willi Beutler’s Neofin Rot formula, but was improved in all parameters. Since about 10 years ADOX is improving this formulary.\nFX-39 is a compensating developer, providing excellent detail rendition, sharpness and resolution. The effective film speed is high. The compensating effect can be well controlled in a very wide range by variations in dilution. The compensating effect can be precisely adjusted to the subject contrast and film type. There remains only one reason for not using FX-39 exclusively and that is absolutely finest grain. If you want the finest grain possible than finest grain developers like Adox Atomal are the optimal solution. FX-39 harmonizes excellently especially with all low- and medium-speed films. In the ISO 400/27° class the best results are obtained with Kodak Tri-X, Kodak T-Max 400, Ilford Delta 400 and Fuji Neopan 400. If needed FX-39 can also be used for increasing film speed by 1 stop (push processing).\nAdox has produced FX-39 for Paterson since 2004. Geoffrey Crawley was here to transfer the formula and to support the implemention of the production. We promised him to keep his „baby“ alive and kicking, even when Paterson may decide to stop the distribution. As Paterson made this decision later on, FX-39 is now not only produced, but also branded and distributed by Adox.\nTechnical data:\n500ml developer concentrate.\nStandard dilution: 1+9 “one-shot” application.\nHigh dilution: 1+19 ”one-shot” application for increase of the compensating effect (by 75% extended developing time). By doing this film speed is a bit lower. So it is possible to trade compensating effect for film speed in a certain range.\nDeveloping times are listed on Digitaltruth.\n\nADOX BABY ADOFIX Plus 100 ml conc.\nFix intended for all black and white photo materials.\nHigh-capacity express fixer for black and white photo paper (RC or Fiber-based), film, and sheetfilm.\n\nIntended for use in trays, tanks, and maschines.\n\nWith one liter of concentrate, you can make up to 10 liters of working solution. Dilution is either 1+4 or 1+9.\n\nCapacity: 1.4 - 2 sq. meters of photo paper or 6-10 films per liter of working solution at 1+9 dilution.\nTotal capacity: 10 films or 45 sheets of 18x24cm photo paper.\n\n\nExcellent price value.\n\nGeneral recomendations for liquid fixers: Liquid fixers stay fresh if kept unopened for about 2 years.\nAfter opening the concentrate shall be used up within about 3 months.\nI case of flockulation or sulfuric fumes the fixer cannot be used anymore.",

Based on the original Vision3 50D emulsion, this film is prepped and rolled for clean and safe standard photo lab processing or Cs41 development at home, but it may also be processed in Cs2 chemistry for low-contrast motion picture negatives. Ideal for shooting in bright light at wide apertures and for producing high resolution, low grain images.\n\nThe exposure latitude of this film is beyond anything digital and even most other films can hope to achieve. With 50D you can achieve beautiful results by rating it anywhere between ISO 12-100 without the need for push processing. No matter how you meter, you will see almost no grain, but color, contrast, shadow detail and highlight rendering will be affected by the chosen ISO you meter at. If you expose at a lower ISO you will get warmer images with greater halation in the highlights.\n\nCineStill's new and improved manufacturing process now extends the shelf life of 50D, with less noticeable artifacts after expiration.

    "Опис": "Filmtype: Colour Slide\nFilm Format: Medium Format 120\nSpeed: ISO 100/21°\nLength: 12 Exposures\nFor about three decades Fujifilm has been market leader in the colour reversal film market (leading in technology and in sales volume). And they have continuously supplied the market with their colour reversal / transparency film types even in the most difficult and problematic times of the market - as the only manufacturer.\n\nWith Provia 100F Fujifilm has established the benchmark for colour reversal films with neutral-natural colour rendition:\nProvia 100F Professional (RDP III) is a medium-sensitive daylight-balanced transparency film with ISO 100/21° with exceptionally fine grain, excellent sharpness and resolution, natural-vivid color reproduction, very wide scale of tone reproduction and extremely neutral gray color balance.\nTypical for all Fujifilm films the differentiation of green tones is very good and the rendition of sky blue is excellent (perfect for landscape photography).\nWhether portrait, fashion, landscape, architecture, product and advertising photography, travel, still-life or night photography, Provia 100F always provides excellent results because of its very well balanced neutral and natural colour rendition and its perfect reproduction of fine details. A real all-round film.\n\nAnother significant advantage of Provia 100F is its excellent flexibility concerning the usable light sensitivity range from Exposure Index (EI) 50/18° to 400/27°:\nExposed at EI 50/18° or 64/19° and with accordingly adjusted pull processing Provia provides really excellent results. Optimal for example for reducing contrast in situations with very high object contrast.\nIf a higher sensitivity is needed, Provia can also be exposed at EI 200/24° without any problems: At that film speed and with accordingly adjusted push-1 processing you will also get really excellent results.\nAnd even an exposure at EI 400/27° in combination with a push-2 processing is possible with still good results.\n\nFujichrome Provia 100F has the widest exposure latitude (and dynamic range) of all current colour reversal films.\nAnd it is cheaper than the other transparency films and offers excellent value for money / excellent price-performance ratio.\n\nAn absolute unique characteristic of Provia 100F is its outstanding performance concerning the reciprocity failure:\nUp to 128 seconds (> 2 minutes) exposure time no exposure compensation is needed! This makes Provia the perfect film for long exposure and night photography. No other colour film can offer that outstanding feature. Provia is a league of its own in this regard.\n\nFujichrome Provia 100F has significant better sharpness, higher resolution and a bit wider exposure latitude compared to Kodak Ektachrome E100. Concerning fineness of grain both films are on the same level. In direct comparison Ektachrome E100 has a bit cooler (more blue) colour rendition.\nTypical for colour reversal film Provia 100F surpasses all colour negative films of the market in the parameters sharpness, resolution, fineness of grain and colour brillance.\n\nProvia 100F 120 rollfilm has - like all Fujifilm colour 120 films - the unique features Easy-Loading System, Easy-End-Seal System und Barcode System, which make the handling much easier.\n\nGeneral colour reversal film tip:\nWith colour reversal / transparency film you have a perfect, finished positive photo already after film processing. You can enjoy the perfect quality without the need of further costly steps: No need for scans or prints (as with colour negative film). Therefore the overall costs per finished final positive picture are often lower with colour reversal film compared to colour negative film.\n\nCurrent expiry date: 07/2023",

Especially colour rendition in shadow areas is visibly different.\n- The characteristic curve has a bit steeper form than that of Velvia 50.

Ilford's SFX is not a \"real\" infrared film like the former Efke IR820 or the Kodak HIE, but it is a film with an extended red sensitivity. The benefit to the user is the better usability and easier processing. The downside is that the photos are not \"true\" infrared images, but photos with an infrared-like effect. However, the film can be given to almost any photo lab for developing and the exposures can be made using just a dark red filter. But the strongest and most visible \"Wood-effect\" is achieved by using an infrared filter which blocks the light below 715nm (e.g. Heliopan RG 715, available here in the shop). Ilford SFX 200 is ideal for infrared-beginners or to try out IR film in a Holga camera.",

    "Опис": "Filmtype: Colour Slide\nFilm Format: Medium Format 120\nSpeed: ISO 100/21°\nLength: 12 Exposures\nA Classic is back!\n\nIn 2012 Kodak had unfortunately stopped their color reversal film production completely. All films were discontinued. Now with the Ektachrome E100 at least one Kodak color reversal / transparency film type is back.\n\nEktachrome E100 offers extremely fine grain, a vivid, brillant color rendition and very good tonality.\nKodak has chosen the former Ektachrome E100 G as basis for the new E100. But because certain raw materials, which were used in former E100 G, are meanwhile not available anymore, the new E100 is different in certain parameters compared to its forerunner E100 G.\n\nThe rendition of blue, especially blue of the sky, is visibly improved (no cyan color cast anymore like with its forerunner and like all current Kodak color negative films).\nThe new E100 has neutral to slightly cool (emphasis of blue) color rendition. Therefore it is visibly different to its forerunner E100 G, which was neutral to slightly warm. The color rendition of E100 is also a bit cooler than the very neutral-natural Fujichrome Provia 100F with its very precise and very well balanced color rendition.\nTherefore Ektachrome E100 with its slightly cooler color rendition takes a unique position in the current Kodak film portfolio: It is the only Kodak film with a tendency towards cooler tones, as all Kodak color negative films have an either slightly warm (Portra 160) or significantly warm (Portra 400 / 800, Ektar, all amateur color negative films) color rendition.\n\nThe extreme fineness of grain of former E100 G could be maintained with new E100 (RMS value of 8).\nBut the resolution of new E100 is unfortunately a little bit lower.\nThe new E100 has a bit steeper gradation (works a bit more contrasty) than its forerunner, and the exposure latitude is a bit lower, too.\n\nIn direct comparison to Fujichrome Provia 100F new Ektachrome E100 has a slightly cooler color rendition.\nFujichrome Provia 100F has a significantly better sharpness, better resolution (higher MTF) and a bit better exposure latitude in comparison to E100.\nConcerning fineness of grain both films are on the same extremely high level.\n\nGeneral colour reversal film tip:\nWith colour reversal / transparency film you have a perfect, finished positive photo already after film processing. You can enjoy the perfect quality without the need of further costly steps: No need for scans or prints (as with colour negative film). Therefore the overall costs per finished final positive picture are often lower with colour reversal film compared to colour negative film.\n\nPrice is for one film only!",

For optimal results a precise exposure is recommended.\n\nAs a low-cost alternative in format 120 / rollfilm many customers prefer using Provia 100F 120, which in addition offers significant higher resolution and better sharpness, and a little bit finer grain.

Made for centuries in Japan, this paper combines just the right physical properties with a unique aesthetic: strong, flexible and transparent, Washi is the ideal medium for creating a hand-crafted photographic film.\n\nWashi film has a basic sensitivity of 25 iso when process in Tetenal Eukobrom at 1+1 dilution (you can reuse the solution for several rolls or sheet-film).\n\nThis Film is orthochromatic: sensitive to the blue end of the spectrum while being relatively insensitive to the red. This means that Washi Film can be handled under a red safelight (> 545nm).\n\nEasy to handle and develop, Washi Film is available in conventional photographic formats: 120, 620 and 4x5. It is processed in normal black and white paper developer. As an handmade product, Washi Film must be carrefully clean with cold clean water to ensure optimal conservation of the negative. Each film is sold with a technical data sheet detailing how to expose and process it. The negative can then either be scanned or printed by contact or with an enlarger. Only traditionnal prints or transparency scan can reveal the full potential of Washi negative. Simple scan would give an overexposed veil over the picture.",

    "Опис": "Filmtype: Colour Print Film\nFilm Format: Special Medium Format 127\nThe Rollei Crossbird is a creative film, with excellent colour fidelity, above average contrast range and high sharpness. As a \"creatively used color film (cross development in the C-41 standard process - negative) with a nominal sensitivity of ISO 200. With the Crossbird the optimum of creative overemphasis of the colour green with simultaneous highlighting of skin tones and the yellow-orange colour space is possible. In the tradition of the popular slide cross films, it is film material that does not allow \"colour falsification\", but \"creative colour accentuation as a stylistic device\".\nBasically, this film is a so-called \"cross-film\". But in the product development it was taken care that color spaces exactly matched the optimum of the fairness in a picture already in the moment of the admission reproduce. This not only resulted in the usual color shift, but also in a film characteristic that allows fairy-tale color embossing and appears pleasant and harmonious to the human eye. With the Crossbird, Rollei offers a photographic use that could be described as a \"fantasy film\". In spite of the creative possibilities, the film brings everything that is required of a modern colour film: High contrast range and optimal sharpness. If it is developed in the \"right\" E-6 process. The Crossbird is equally suitable for lomographic photography as well as for use in precise camera systems. With this a film is available, which allows in the purely analog as well as hybrid processing the maximum of realistic and at the same time imaginative image design without lengthy additional processing. Crossbird is a correctly wound, correctly signed, 200 ISO colour slide film, crystal clear.",

Core-Shell™ crystal technology results in excellent sharpness, very high resolution and very fine grain at higher sensitivities. Good negative characteristics. Delta 100 has a bit better sharpness and higher resolution than PanF+. But PanF+ has a bit finer grain.\nDelta 100 surpasses in many developers T-Max 100 and Acros II 100 in contour/edge sharpness. It is also significantly sharper, higher resolving and finer grained than all ISO 100/21° films with conventional grain technology like e.g. FP4+, Kentmere 100, Fomapan 100 etc..\nThe characteristic curve of Delta 100 can be well controlled by the choice of developer. E.g. with Ilford DD-X, XTOL or Tetenal Ultrafin T-Plus you get a very linear characteristic curve. And with a compensating developer like ADOX ATOMAL and ADOX FX-39 II you get a characteristic curve with the compensating effect resulting in lower densities in the highlights. From a technological point of view Delta 100 is one of the best films in Ilford's film portfolio.",

However, its high flexibility in terms of light sensitivity also allows you to set your camera to ISO 200 (24°) and ISO 100 (21°). This gives you more options for experimentation in different lighting conditions. Green tones will become a shiny purple when you use an ISO 100 setting, but with an ISO 400 setting greens will instead become a darker indigo. This gives you the opportunity to create everything from soft lavender hues to the most vibrant violets.\n\n\nAlong with creating dazzling colors, the new formula produces dynamic photos with superior sharpness — and now with even finer grain than ever before! This new film also allows you to shoot in any weather condition and achieves beautiful effects without using any special filters.\n\nStandard Development\nThe New LomoChrome Purple should be developed with the standard C-41 process",

The best thing about it: All of this is possible with just a single roll of film.\n\nDecide on your desired effect and set the appropriate ISO default. If you are looking for intense red tones and an atmospheric orange, choose ISO 200/24°.

This effect of light penetrating through the base into the cartridge is immanent to all polyester-based films and cannot be fully prevented. CHS 100 II should be protected from bright light which can fog the first few frames. It is best to be loaded in the shadow or subdued light.\n\nCHS 100 II sharpness and contrast can be managed with various developers: velvety soft results in Atomal, balanced contrast and optimal sharpness in FX-39 and elevated contrast with extra high definition in Adonal/Rodinal. Tanning developers are not recommended.",

Along with classical grain, CHS 100 II is perfect for fine art photography, delivering a true 1960’s film look.\n\nThis film is made of two emulsions coated in a single layer on an archival clear PET 100 micron base, resulting in very large exposure latitude. CHS 100 II responds very well to push-processing.\n\nIn the 35mm format ADOX CHS100 II has two anti-halation layers (between the emulsion and the base and on the backside), making it ultra sharp.

E.g. with Ilford DD-X, XTOL or Tetenal Ultrafin T-Plus you get a very linear characteristic curve. And with a compensating developer like ADOX ATOMAL and ADOX FX-39 II you get a characteristic curve with the compensating effect resulting in lower densities in the highlights. From a technological point of view Delta 100 is one of the best films in Ilford's film portfolio.",

All films were discontinued. Now with the Ektachrome E100 at least one Kodak color reversal / transparency film type is back.\n\nEktachrome E100 offers extremely fine grain, a vivid, brillant color rendition and very good tonality.\nKodak has chosen the former Ektachrome E100 G as basis for the new E100. But because certain raw materials, which were used in former E100 G, are meanwhile not available anymore, the new E100 is different in certain parameters compared to its forerunner E100 G.\n\nThe rendition of blue, especially blue of the sky, is visibly improved (no cyan color cast anymore like with its forerunner and like all current Kodak color negative films).\nThe new E100 has neutral to slightly cool (emphasis of blue) color rendition. Therefore it is visibly different to its forerunner E100 G, which was neutral to slightly warm. The color rendition of E100 is also a bit cooler than the very neutral-natural Fujichrome Provia 100F with its very precise and very well balanced color rendition.\nTherefore Ektachrome E100 with its slightly cooler color rendition takes a unique position in the current Kodak film portfolio: It is the only Kodak film with a tendency towards cooler tones, as all Kodak color negative films have an either slightly warm (Portra 160) or significantly warm (Portra 400 / 800, Ektar, all amateur color negative films) color rendition.\n\nThe extreme fineness of grain of former E100 G could be maintained with new E100 (RMS value of 8).\nBut the resolution of new E100 is unfortunately a little bit lower.\nThe new E100 has a bit steeper gradation (works a bit more contrasty) than its forerunner, and the exposure latitude is a bit lower, too.\n\nIn direct comparison to Fujichrome Provia 100F new Ektachrome E100 has a slightly cooler color rendition.\nFujichrome Provia 100F has a significantly better sharpness, better resolution (higher MTF) and a bit better exposure latitude in comparison to E100.\nConcerning fineness of grain both films are on the same extremely high level.\n\nGeneral colour reversal film tip:\nWith colour reversal / transparency film you have a perfect, finished positive photo already after film processing. You can enjoy the perfect quality without the need of further costly steps: No need for scans or prints (as with colour negative film). Therefore the overall costs per finished final positive picture are often lower with colour reversal film compared to colour negative film.\n\nCurrent expiration date: 11/2023",

Try with a Holga too.\n\nExposed at EI 400/27° this film has a very strong S-shaped characteristic curve. This results in a very contrasty look with very low levels of shadow detail and very clearly separated mid-tones. If such contrasty look is not wanted it is recommended to expose with 2-3 stops more light and adjust development time accordingly (shorter development time).\nPhotographers who prefer optimal shadow detail, highest light sensitivity and evenly graded grey tones in their infrared photography will find their optimal film in ILFORD SFX 200.",

With high sensitivity to blue, less to green and no sensitivity to red light, this film gives best results with urban, portrait and still life photography.\n\nWashi Film is a black and white photographic film developed from traditional paper, Washi. Made for centuries in Japan, this paper combines just the right physical properties with a unique aesthetic: strong, flexible and transparent, Washi is the ideal medium for creating a hand-crafted photographic film.\n\nWashi film has a basic sensitivity of 25 iso when process in Tetenal Eukobrom at 1+1 dilution (you can reuse the solution for several rolls or sheet-film).\n\nThis Film is orthochromatic: sensitive to the blue end of the spectrum while being relatively insensitive to the red. This means that Washi Film can be handled under a red safelight (> 545nm).\n\nEasy to handle and develop, Washi Film is available in conventional photographic formats: 120, 620 and 4x5. It is processed in normal black and white paper developer. As an handmade product, Washi Film must be carrefully clean with cold clean water to ensure optimal conservation of the negative. Each film is sold with a technical data sheet detailing how to expose and process it. The negative can then either be scanned or printed by contact or with an enlarger. Only traditionnal prints or transparency scan can reveal the full potential of Washi negative. Simple scan would give an overexposed veil over the picture.\nAs Washi large format films are much thinner and flexible than regular sheet-films, it could be sometimes harder to load in film-holders. To make this operation easier, you can place a piece of photo paper of the same size above the Washi Film and load it together. Then you can take away the photo paper and leave the sheet-film in position.",
