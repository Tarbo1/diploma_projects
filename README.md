## There are two projects:
* Project_1 
* Project_2

## Project_1
This folder contains two different, unrelated stages of the project: photo_impex_parse.ipynb and related files, and a folder called "Stage_2_Visual". photo_impex_parse.ipynb contains code that uses Selenium to parse the catalogue (and its categories) of the film shop "Photo Impex" and put it into a .json file.
Stage_2_Visual folder contains .csv data from kaggle about passengers rating airline services (such as food, entertainment and so on) and visual conclusion of this data in PowerBI in Ukrainian language.

## Project_2

1. Python (ended with transformation of data into SQLite3 database);
2.  PowerBI;
3. Machine learning and prediction using Python and sklearn library.
